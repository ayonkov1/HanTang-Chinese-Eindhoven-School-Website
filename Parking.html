<p align="center"> Parking 
	<p> There is a parking ban along the sidewalk on the side of the school. It is allowed to leave the car there for a while to let children get in or out while the driver stays in the car.
Every driver must try to park the car in the school's car park as long as there is still room, even if they park for a short time.
Parking in front of or near houses in the streets around the school is strongly discouraged, because this causes inconvenience.
In the 2013/14 school year, several local residents complained about the parking behavior of the school's visitors on Saturday. There are even flyers in the area that call for action and people have complained to the Eckart College school management. Not only do local residents experience inconvenience from parking in front of their home, but there is even parking in illegal places. For example, there was parking in front of garages and driveways, which is prohibited by law and very annoying for people who want to get their car out of the garage. Parking is prohibited on Damocleslaan, on the side of the school. On the extension of the Damocleslaan, the Nuenenseweg, parking is also not allowed and tickets are issued for it. There is no traffic sign that prohibits parking, because it is clear that the road there is too narrow, with parked cars, the fire brigade can no longer pass and it becomes very dangerous for cyclists. Some people put their car half in the grass there. That is not allowed either. Moreover, there are almost always more than 60 parking spaces at the De Combinatie Jeugdzorg Nuenenseweg 4 building (200 meters from the school) on Saturdays.</p>
