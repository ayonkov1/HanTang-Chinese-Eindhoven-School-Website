<div class="SchoolHistory">
<p>In 1978 the Eindhoven Chinese School was founded by the Association of 
Eindhoven Chinese Protestants in Eindhoven. At that time there were only 20 
students who learned Cantonese from Hong Kong textbooks every Saturday in a 
caf√© on the Grote Berg.</p>
<p>In 1986 the number of pupils grew to 120. At that time, the Association 
of Chinese Protestants in Eindhoven thought it more practical to share 
responsibility with the Chinese Association in Eindhoven. The Chinese 
school also approached the municipality for help. That was initially 
refused, but the actions of the students under the direction of the 
school brought the municipal administration to a different mind. In 
1987 we were allowed to use the Genderdal public school for free, 
but unfortunately we had to move in November 1989 when the municipality 
sold the buildings. After that, the organization of the school changed in 
a number of steps. Since 1993, the school has been supervised by the 
Eindhoven Chinese School Foundation, which was then established. The 
Foundation monitors education as well as finances.</p>
